let me tell  you the folder sturcture : 
1- Make a folder src paste file input.css

2- make a folder build and inside it make 2 folders 'css','img'.

Now add file index.html inside folder'build' and inside build.
paste 'style.css' inside folder- 'css' and paste images inside folder 'img'

this is for the tailwind to work properly
